### **Introduction**

This repository contains a **line follower algorithm** designed for the **Parrot Mini Drone**, built using **Simulink MATLAB**. The algorithm enables the drone to autonomously track a **red line** and land on a designated **circle** using its onboard camera.

### **Algorithm Overview**

#### **1. Line Detection and Heading Calculation**
- **Edge Detection** using the Canny edge filter to detect red lines.
- **Hough Line Transform** to extract straight lines.
- **Line Selection** to choose prominent lines representing the red line.
- **Heading Calculation** using the average of these lines.

#### **2. Bitmap-based Approach for Heading Adjustment**
- Define **Regions of Interest (ROIs)** in the camera feed.
- **Bitmap Intersection Analysis** to refine the drone's heading using the red line.
- **X-mark Generation** for more accurate trajectory stabilization.

#### **Landing Feature**
- **Circle Detection** using MATLAB’s `imfindcircles()` function.
- **Landing Decision** based on ROI detection.

### **System Requirements**
- **Hardware**: Parrot Mini Drone
- **Software**:  
  - MATLAB  
  - Simulink  
  - Computer Vision Toolbox  
- **Operating System**: Windows/macOS/Linux
- **Communication Interface**: Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

---

### **Usage Instructions**

1. **Drone Setup**: Ensure your drone is fully charged and connected to your system.
2. **MATLAB Configuration**: Open the MATLAB project. Install required toolboxes.
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust camera settings and thresholds based on your drone’s environment.
4. **Run Algorithm**: Start the Simulink model to make the drone follow the red line.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Observe the drone’s trajectory and fine-tune parameters.
6. **Optimization**: Modify code based on challenges like sharp turns or lighting.

---

### **Challenges Faced & Improvements**

#### **1. Handling Sharp Turns**  
The algorithm struggled with turns less than 60 degrees, causing the drone to overshoot.

**Improvement Suggestion**:  
Implementing a path prediction mechanism and adjusting speed dynamically during turns.

#### **2. Inefficient Circle Detection for Landing**  
Premature landing or missing the landing circle was common due to speed miscalculations.

**Improvement Suggestion**:  
Developing a dynamic ROI based on speed and trajectory would provide smoother landing decisions.
